/*
The goal of this program is to create a push button class in Arduino, which can detect when a button is pressed or released.
The main theme of this program is digital input and output control.
Private : pin and state
Public constructor with pin Is pressed
*/

// Define a class named "Push Botton"
class Push Botton {
// Private variables of the class
private:
int pin;
bool state;

// Public methods of the class
public:
// Constructor method that takes an integer pin number as an argument
Push Botton(int pin){
this->pin = pin; // Store the pin number in the class variable
state = false; // Set the initial state of the button to "not pressed"
pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Set the pin mode to "INPUT_PULLUP"
}
bool isPressed(){
  bool currentState = digitalRead(pin) == LOW; // Read the current state of the button
  state = true; // Update the state variable to indicate that the button has been pressed
  return true;
}

// Method to check if the button has been released since the last check
elseif(! currentState && state){
  state = false; // Update the state variable to indicate that the button has been released
}
